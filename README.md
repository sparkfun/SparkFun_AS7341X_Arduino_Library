[*SparkX 10-Channel Spectral Sensor AS7341L (SPX-17719)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17719)

AS7341L1 is a 10-channel spectrometer capable of measuring spectral in 10 different channels: 415nm, 445nm, 480nm, 515nm, 555nm, 590nm, 630nm, 680nm, clear and near infrared. 

This sensor will measure the color components in a specific target, decomposing a specific light color into the individual components above. 

If you need to measure the color composition of a target which needs illumination the board also provides two leds for target illumination: one bright white led and an infrared led which can be turned on or off using I^2^C. LED driving current is also programmable via I^2^C.
